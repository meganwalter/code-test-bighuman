# Big Human styling code test

## Installation:

- `git clone git@github.com:meganwalter/code-test-bighuman.git`
- `open index.html in a browser window`

## Notes:

-I kept it pretty simple, just an html page, styled with sass (compiled with node-sass), using very basic js to work the navigation display functionality.

-I used a media queries mixin trick I learned [here](https://medium.com/codeartisan/breakpoints-and-media-queries-in-scss-46e8f551e2f2)

-I used a div instead of a select field in the nav because the assignment stated I didn't need functionality for internationalization. When I looked up the html element for options, they do not support spans or image elements inside of them, so most blogs/forums that I read suggest using other elements and styling to appear like a select drop down.
  --Please let me know if there is something I didn't find online, I love to learn new tricks.

-Thank you for taking the time to review this project, I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback.
